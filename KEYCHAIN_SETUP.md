# Hive Keychain Installation Guide

## What is Hive Keychain?

Hive Keychain is a browser extension that securely manages your Hive blockchain credentials. It allows you to sign transactions and authenticate without exposing your private keys to web applications.

## Installation

### Chrome/Chromium browsers:
1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hive-keychain/jcacnejopjdphbnjgfaaobbfafkihpep)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Confirm by clicking "Add extension"

### Firefox:
1. Visit [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hive-keychain/)
2. Click "Add to Firefox"
3. Confirm the installation

### Edge:

2. Click "Get"
3. Confirm the installation

## Setup

1. After installation, click the Keychain icon in your browser
2. Click "Add Account"
3. Enter your Hive username
4. Import your keys (you can import just the posting key for this admin portal)
5. Set up a master password to secure your keys

## Using with Snapie Admin

1. Make sure Keychain is installed and set up
2. Log in to the admin portal with your Hive username
3. Check "Use Hive Keychain" (should be selected automatically if detected)
4. Click "Sign in with Hive"
5. Keychain will prompt you to sign the authentication challenge
6. Approve the signature to complete login

## Benefits

- **Security**: Your private keys never leave the browser extension
- **Convenience**: No need to manually enter posting keys
- **Standard**: Used by most Hive applications
- **Trusted**: Maintained by the Hive community

## Fallback Option

If you don't have Keychain installed, you can still use the admin portal by:
1. Unchecking "Use Hive Keychain"
2. Entering your posting key manually
3. The key is used only for signing and is never stored

**Note**: Installing Keychain is highly recommended for better security.
